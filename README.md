# 4Experience-College-Scripts

The game was made during 4Experience-College. Simple tower defense in which we build various towers and use skills to defend a castle against waves of enemies. I used external assets to create the project, which is reason why I couldn't upload the entiere project. I upload only [video gameplay](https://youtu.be/iOvioqpRvQ4) and code written during the course.
